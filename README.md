## Task 0 (get familiar with Git and GitHub):
1. [x] Finish the course [How to use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)
2. [x] Finish [try.github.io](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
3. [x] Create repository named "kottans_frontend".
4. [x] Create README.md for the repository.
5. [x] Describe your impressions about learned materials.
6. [x] Send a pull-request to repo [Kottans/mock-repo](https://github.com/Kottans/mock-repo) proposing a change. It could be anything, really. If you have found a typo in README - great! Take care to give your PR a meaningful name and description.


### Task 0 reflections:
> 1. Udacity's How to use Git and GitHub course is a really detailed, interactive and fun experience. Great visual explanation of what's a branch and commit. How to create repository on Github. Really liked feedback on Git from other developers and engineers. Helped me to fill some gaps here and there.
> 2. I have came across *try.github.io* in the past. A nice, visual introduction in to the world of Git.

## Test Task 1

1. [x] [Linux Command Line Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/linux-command-line-basics--ud595)
2. [x] [Configuring Linux Web Servers](https://www.udacity.com/course/configuring-linux-web-servers--ud299)
3. [x] [Networking for Web Developers](https://www.udacity.com/course/networking-for-web-developers--ud256)
4. [x] [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177)
5. [x] [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155)


### Task 1 reflections:
> 1. Great introduction into the command line. The new thing for me was the globbing pattern with the curly braces (e.g. *{html,css}). Will definitely use it.
> 2. Really liked course on Configuring Linux Web Servers. Setting up Apache HTTP Server with mod_wsgi and PostgreSQL was all new experience for me. Vagrant is an awesome tool. It's surprisingly easy to get up and running Linux server on your own machine. Definitely will add Vagrant in my tool box.
> 3. A very interesting in-depth course on networks. A lot of new information for me, such as protocol layers, different commands such as, `nc` or `traceroute`. It is pretty amazing how much there's protocols, 'hops', routers, etc. could be involved just between two endpoints. A lot of information in this course that will take some time to digest.

## Test Task 2

0. [x] [What is Version Control](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud123/)

1. [x] [GitHub & Collaboration](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud456)


### Task 2 reflections:
> 1. In the What is Version Control course using Relative Commit References was really new to me. It's a cool feature and I would definitely use in the future. The more I use Git the more I understand what an powerful tool for a developer it is.
> 2. Collaborating with others could be really challenging for someone who is new to Git. Nevertheless, it's definitely worth the effort. I'll definitely use most of the commands from the course in the future. Finally, I got a good clarification between `pull` and `fetch` commands. After going through all of Udacity's courses on Git I am really surprised what a versatile tool Git is. It might have a steeper learning curve, but it's worth it.
