## Task 0 (get familiar with Git and GitHub):
1. [x] Finish the course [How to use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)
2. [x] Finish [try.github.io](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
3. [x] Create repository named "kottans_frontend".
4. [x] Create README.md for the repository.
5. [x] Describe your impressions about learned materials.
6. [x] Send a pull-request to repo [Kottans/mock-repo](https://github.com/Kottans/mock-repo) proposing a change. It could be anything, really. If you have found a typo in README - great! Take care to give your PR a meaningful name and description.


### Task 0 reflections:
> 1. Udacity's How to use Git and GitHub course is a really detailed, interactive and fun experience. Great visual explanation of what's a branch and commit. How to create repository on Github. Really liked feedback on Git from other developer and engineers.
> 2.I have came across *try.github.io* in the past. A nice, visual introduction in to the world of Git.
