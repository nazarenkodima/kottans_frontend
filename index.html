                This command:

                lists one commit per line
                shows the first 7 characters of the commit's SHA
                shows the commit's message
            </pre>
        </dd>

        <dt>$ git log --stat</dt>
        <dd>
            <pre>
                This command:

                displays the file(s) that have been modified
                displays the number of lines that have been added/removed
                displays a summary line with the total number of modified files and lines that have been added/removed
            </pre>
        </dd>

        <dt>$ git log -p</dt>
        <dd>
            <pre>
                This command adds the following to the default output:

                displays the files that have been modified
                displays the location of the lines that have been added/removed
                displays the actual changes that have been made
            </pre>
        </dd>

        <dt>$ git show</dt>
        <dd>
            <pre>
                The git show command will show only one commit.

                However, git show can be combined with most of the other flags we've looked at:
                --stat - to show the how many files were changed and the number of lines that were added/removed
                -p or --patch - this the default, but if --stat is used, the patch won't display, so pass -p to add it again
                -w - to ignore changes to whitespace
            </pre>
        </dd>
